Teams will be provided 220 volts 50 Hz AC supply.<br/>The maximum potential difference between any two points on the bot should not exceed 24 volts.<br/>Grabbing the ball is not allowed. So bots should not have any kind of grabbing mechanisms.<br/>GAME-PLAY<br/>Teams will have to play a football match against other team.

The team to score first goal during the extra time will win the match. If no goal is scored during extra time, winner will be decided by penalty shoot outs during which 2 penalty shoots will be given to each team in turn. The better of two penalties will be considered to decide the winner.<br/>During Penalty shoots, only one bot (i.e. the striker) will be placed in arena and ball will be placed at the centre of the arena.
